ERROR: Invalid map configuration

Map data must appear last in the configuration file and be properly enclosed.

Expected format:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  111111111111                           │
  │  100000000001                           │

  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Valid characters:
  0     <- Floor (walkable area)
  1     <- Wall
  N     <- Player spawn facing North
  S     <- Player spawn facing South
  E     <- Player spawn facing East
  W     <- Player spawn facing West
  space <- Empty area (must not be accessible)

Examples of valid maps:
  ✓ Map fully enclosed by walls ('1')
  ✓ Contains exactly one player position (N, S, E, or W)
  ✓ No gaps or holes in wall boundaries
  ✓ All walkable areas ('0') are enclosed

Examples of invalid maps:
  ✗ 11111              <- Map not closed
     10001
     10N01
     1000

  ✗ 111111             <- Multiple player positions
     10N001
     10S001
     111111

  ✗ 111111             <- Hole in the map
     10 001
     10N001
     111111

  ✗ 111111             <- Walkable area touches edge
     000001
     10N001
     111111

Rules:
  • Map must be completely enclosed by walls ('1').
  • Exactly one player position (N, S, E, or W) is required.
  • No empty lines allowed within map data.
  • Spaces inside the map must not be adjacent to walkable areas.
  • All walkable areas ('0') must be fully enclosed.
  • Map must appear after textures and colours.
