ERROR: Colour definition out of order

Colours must be defined after textures and before map data.

Expected format:
  F R,G,B    <- Floor colour (e.g., F 220,100,0)
  C R,G,B    <- Ceiling colour (e.g., C 225,30,0)

Rules:
  • RGB values must be integers between 0 and 255.
  • Both floor (F) and ceiling (C) must be defined.
  • No duplicate definitions allowed.
